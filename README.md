# The simple calculus app!
---
## 1. What does it do? 
    The app currently only supports polynomials, and can do the following calculations:
    i) Derive the polynomial (d/dx)
    ii) Find a limit of the polynomial (incl. inf)
    iii) Solve f(x)=0 (find roots)
    iv) Factor the polynomial
    v) Apply the Bolzano Theorem
    vi) Apply the Rolle Theorem (Under Construction)

## 2. WIP Alert!! 
This project is a WIP (Work In Progress) Project. Expect Bugs, and feel free to report them on the repository. Updates are coming soon!
